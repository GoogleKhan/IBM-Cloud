Hi Ryan, 

Thanks for the feedback. We could replicate the mentioned scenario. On analysis we found that as per the current design, on selecting all available zones for a well/run, all depth check box gets selected automatically assuming the all available zones together cover all depth. Now we understand that this assumption is inaccurate. 


We have added it to our tasks list and would sure correct this behavior. Hope it is fine. 

We will welcome your guidance. 

Thanks & Regards
